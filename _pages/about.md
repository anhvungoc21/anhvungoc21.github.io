Hi there!

I am currently a junior at Grinnell College with a major in Computer Science and a concentration in Statistics. Most excitingly, I will be joining Meta this summer as a software engineering intern in NYC!

My past experiences span front-end, back-end, cloud, and ML. For the past few months though, I have focused my efforts into thoroughly pursuing ML development. Currently, I am most interested in cool and advanced ML applications for creating and enhancing audio and music.

All of my previous work are detailed in my [resume](/resume/) and [projects](/projects/) section.

I have also documented my journey with classical music &mdash; my other burning passion &mdash; [here](/music/) as well!

Feel free to shoot me an email at [anhvungoc.21@gmail.com](mailto:anhvungoc.21@gmail.com). \
