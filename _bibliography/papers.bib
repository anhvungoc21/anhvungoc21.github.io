    Rigorous, mathematical reasoning, i.e., proof, is the foundation of any undergraduate computer science education. However, students find mathematical proof exceedingly challenging, but also at the same time do not see its relevance to programming. We address these concerns with Snowflake, an educational proof assistant designed to help undergraduates overcome these difficulties when authoring mathematical proof. Snowflake does this by operating in a context where mathematical proof is introduced alongside programming in either a CS1 or CS2 context. The lens that we use to unite the two concepts is program correctness, a topic that immediately makes relevant the concept of formal reasoning as students are perpetually faced with the issue of whether their code is correct. Snowflake is a proof assistant designed for the needs of undergraduates in courses that closely time programming and proof. It is a web-based application that helps students author proofs not only in the context of program correctness in-the-small, but also other topics found in discrete mathematics courses. We report on the design of Snowflake, the kinds of reasoning it enables, and our plans to deploy Snowflake in the classroom.

    Sepsis and septic shock are life-threatening medical conditions caused by blood infection,
    resulting in unwanted reactions from the human immune system. As the outcome of these conditions
    benefits from early intervention, there is increasing interest in the prognostic value of various
    biomarkers, especially lactate level, established to effectively categorize sepsis severity and predict
    patient survival. To explore and verify these predictive values, we applied random forest and logistic
    regression models, with bagging and cross-validation for minimal overfitting, to data on patients at
    the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases, Vietnam. Out-of-sample accuracy and area under the
    curves (AUC) of receiver operating character (ROC) curves were used to assess these models. Our
    results reinforced the merits of regularly monitoring lactate levels (AUC = 0.77, accuracy = 76.12%),
    and identified predictive potential for procalcitonin level, along with other infection biomarkers, in
    blood (AUC = 0.66, accuracy = 71.64%). Future studies should account for time of death and focus
    on procalcitonin level in blood as a predictor in combination with other infection biomarkers.
